            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Edukera began in 2015 with the conviction that in an ever-changing industry, professionals need to continuously upskill themselves in order to stay relevant. Since then we have always focused on building a great online learning experience by collaborating with the right universities and industry partners. We then steadily built a strong support system around our learners. Starting with our first program in Entrepreneurship, upGrad has created some of India’s largest online programs to help thousands of professionals achieve their career goals in the areas of data technology, and management. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Best Online Education Site</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions
                that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual
                classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar
                school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the
                spread of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous,
                 But may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management
                System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital
                technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well. </p>
